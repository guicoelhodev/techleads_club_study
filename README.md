# Tech Leads Club Notes

- This project contains several summaries related to the `tech-leads academy` platform.
- Each topic is separated into its own file inside the `notes` folder.
- Instead of using markdown, I use a tool called `typst`. If you've ever worked with `LaTeX`, this will be nothing new.

## Why I'm using Typst

- Typst is a tool built in Rust for generating PDFs with many features that markdown doesn't support. It also has hot reload when installed locally, which helps a lot when adding new notes.

## Do I need to download this on my computer?

- No, you only need to download it if you're curious about the tool. If you just want to access the generated PDFs, go to the `releases` tab of this project. There you'll find all the PDFs.

### I want to try this tool

- Typst is an open-source tool, to learn more visit [here](https://typst.app/open-source/#download)
